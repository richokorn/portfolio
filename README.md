# Portfolio CMS

## Portfolio template, made using Netlify CMS

### What:

This is a template portfolio from: https://github.com/upleveled/portfolio-cms
It has been minimally edited with some humerous information here and there

### Why:

This portfolio repository exists primarily for testing and learning:

- localhost environment editing and testing with VSCode.
- pulling, committing and pushing to GitHub with VSCode's inbuilt VIM and various other terminals.
- getting comfortable with non-GUI repo management

### Who:

The edits were completed by me, Richard Korn. The original repo and author can be found at the above link.

### How:

This project is a template, only the README.md and index.js files have been modified.

### Where:

This repo can either be manually downloaded into a project file of choice, or cloned using `gh repo clone richokorn/portfolio`

### When:

This project was

- created on 10.01.2022
- completed on 11.01.2022

## Comfort-Zone Challenges:

Running UpLeveled's EsLint [ preflight ] and deploying on Netlify was a little counter-intuitive considering the preflight was done _after_ deployment.

# Deploy on Netlify

Use `export` as build command

```js
yarn export
```
